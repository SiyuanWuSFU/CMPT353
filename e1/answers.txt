1. Numpy is easier to work with, but output from pandas is more detailed. 
2. The running time using panda is around 8.46ms, and the running time for using loops is around 363ms. 
   The possible reason is that panda utilize functions from numpy, and numpy does vectorized calculation which enables 
  multiply array elements to be calculated parallelly.
