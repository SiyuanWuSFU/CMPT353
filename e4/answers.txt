1. Temperature is not a good way to predict population density. Assuming there is a relation between
 temperature and population density. From the scatter plot, cities with population density from 0 to 3000 
are almost evenly distributed in the temperature range of 10 to 30 degrees, which contradicts the
 hypothesis that a linear relationship exists between population density and temperatures. 

2. The "lines = True " when taking the JSON data breaks the data into chunks to fit into 
the memory. In memory, the data can be decompressed and processed faster than 
decompressing the data in HDD and sent into memory for processing.
