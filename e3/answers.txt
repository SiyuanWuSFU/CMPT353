1. For smoothing the CPU temperature, LOESS does a better job compare to Kalman smoothing
    as its result appears to be a relatively stable line. Whereas for Kalman smoothing, 
    the temperature line fluctuates constantly.
2. If other data and their relation to latitude and longitude are known, they can be used and 
    form a more detailed transition matrix, resulting in more accurate smoothing.
