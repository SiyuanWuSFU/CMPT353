1. KNN did the best for the colour prediction for both RGB and HSV. It works the best probably because 
the same colour tends to group together and form cluster-like distribution, which allows KNN to have 
better accuracy. Only in the Bayesian classifier, HSV has a significant advantage. In HSV, there is a hue axis
 which is the main property that decides the colour, and the Bayesian classifier can fully utilize this property.

2. I think the mistakes are reasonable as some locations are very close to each other, which results in identical weather.
 Adding humidity and precipitation may help a lot in this case.
