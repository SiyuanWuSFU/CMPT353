1. The square root transformation gives the closest satisfying assumption of one variable passing the normality test and having equal variance. 

2. The null hypothesis for the original T-test and transformed T-test is the average comment posted on weekdays and weekends are the same. 
Therefore, if the hypothesis is rejected, the conclusion would be the average comment posted on weekdays and weekends are different. 

3. The central limit theorem is the best approach as both variables passed the normality test, and the data has equal variance. It is also better
than the U-test because the view count from weekdays and weekends is not very evenly shuffled in the original data. 

4. Weekdays have more comments posted on average.
